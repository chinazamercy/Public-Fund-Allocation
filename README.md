# Transparent Public Fund Allocation

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, accountable, and efficient management of public funds from budget approval through expenditure to impact measurement.

## Overview

The Transparent Public Fund Allocation (TPFA) platform leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, auditable record of public fund management.
